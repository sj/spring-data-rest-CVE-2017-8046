= Spring Data REST

The goal of the project is to provide a flexible and configurable mechanism for writing simple services that can be exposed over HTTP.

The first exporter implemented is a JPA Repository exporter. This takes your JPA repositories and front-ends them with HTTP, allowing you full CRUD capability over your entities, to include managing associations.

* Create https://jira.spring.io/browse/DATAREST[JIRA] tickets for bugs and new features and comment and vote on the ones that you are interested in.
* Github is for social coding: if you want to write code, we encourage contributions through pull requests from http://help.github.com/forking/[forks of this repository]. If you want to contribute code this way, please reference a JIRA ticket as well covering the specific issue you are addressing.

Before we accept a non-trivial patch or pull request we will need you to https://cla.pivotal.io/sign/spring[sign the Contributor License Agreement]. Signing the contributorâ€™s agreement does not grant anyone commit rights to the main repository, but it does mean that we can accept your contributions, and you will get an author credit if we do. If you forget to do so, you'll be reminded when you submit a pull request. Active contributors might be asked to join the core team, and given the ability to merge pull requests.

=== Note

We disabled the github issues since we want to use https://jira.spring.io/browse/DATAREST[JIRA] as the only issue tracker.
All open existing issues have been automatically imported into JIRA, so nothing was lost :)
